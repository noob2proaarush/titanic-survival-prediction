# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the **GrowthLink Data Science Internship**. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, etc.

---

# Objective

- Predict survival outcome of Titanic passengers.
- Apply proper data cleaning, preprocessing, and encoding.
- Train models with and without SMOTE for class balancing.
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üóÇ Dataset

We used the Titanic dataset available via Seaborn, which includes:
- **Numerical features**: age, fare, number of siblings/spouses
- **Categorical features**: sex, embarkation port, class
- **Target variable**: `survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
